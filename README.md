You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. 
The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit.
Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [2,5,8]
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
